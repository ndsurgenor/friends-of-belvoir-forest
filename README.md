## Initial Development

Three user stories were created at the outset of this project to guide its initial design and provide goals for the finished project:
- User A: as someone who is a resident of the local area, I want to know more about *Friends of Belvoir Park* (*FBP*) so I can decide if its something I want to be a part of.
- User B: as someone who is aware of *FBP* but only at a basic level, I want to find out what specific events *FBP* run and when they're happening so I can decide what to take part in.
- User C: as someone who is passionate about green spaces and caring for the environment, I would like to join *FBP* so I can take an active role in a ‘green community’.

The intial design ideas were developed using the interactive prototyping site [Uizard.io](https://app.uizard.io/p/517cac80)

- Add
- Reformat contact form to load message within iframe

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.
